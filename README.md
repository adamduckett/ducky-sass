# Ducky Sass
This is a sample Sass project architecture using the [Atomic design](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) methodology.

At the moment, apart from [`normalize.css`](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) resets, there are no styles included with Ducky Sass; only a directory structure. However, this may change in the future if I feel including example Sass would be beneficial.

Each folder contains its own `README.md` file explaining its purpose.
