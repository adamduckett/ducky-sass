# Ducky Sass
This is a sample Sass project architecture using the [Atomic design](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) methodology.

Apart from [`normalize.css`](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) resets there are no styles included; only a directory structure.

Each folder contains its own `README.md` file explaining its purpose.
