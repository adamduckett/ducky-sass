# Shame
The `shame/` folder is optional but I regularly make use of it in my projects. Need to apply a quick fix you totally plan on re-writing later? Put it here. It's especially useful on projects involving multiple developers as it makes the code we're all embarrassed to own up to 'public' for all to see.
